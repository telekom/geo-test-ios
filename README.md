A project to test the accuracy of iOS geofence and visits monitoring

## About this component

This is a sample app to test the accurarcy of iOS geofencing and vists monitoring. You can create new geofences, and you will receive a push notification when these geofences are entered or exited.

You will also receive a push message whenever iOS detects a 'Visit'.

All of these events are logged, the log can be shared using the usual iOS sharing tools.

Please use the App for your own testing, and feel free to contribute! Also, I am most interested in your results!

### Accessibility

The goal for this tool is to be accessible. It includes a custom Voiceover rotor for the map. 

## Build

* Clone the project
* Adjust Code Signing Team as appropriate
* IF you want to use [MS AppCenter](https://appcenter.ms) for distribution AND you have an API Key, enter it in `GeofenceTester/Keys.swift`. **REMEMBER** Do not commit your secret keys to a public repository, push request, etc.
* Build and run with Xcode 13.4 or later
